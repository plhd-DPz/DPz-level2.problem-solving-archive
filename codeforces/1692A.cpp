/*==================
A. Marathon
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
You are given four distinct integers a
, b
, c
, d
.

Timur and three other people are running a marathon. The value a
 is the distance that Timur has run and b
, c
, d
 correspond to the distances the other three participants ran.

Output the number of participants in front of Timur.

Input
The first line contains a single integer t
 (1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases.

The description of each test case consists of four distinct integers a
, b
, c
, d
 (0≤a,b,c,d≤104
).

Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the number of participants in front of Timur.

Note
For the first test case, there are 2
 people in front of Timur, specifically the participants who ran distances of 3
 and 4
. The other participant is not in front of Timur because he ran a shorter distance than Timur.

For the second test case, no one is in front of Timur, since he ran a distance of 10000
 while all others ran a distance of 0
, 1
, and 2
 respectively.

For the third test case, only the second person is in front of Timur, who ran a total distance of 600
 while Timur ran a distance of 500
.
